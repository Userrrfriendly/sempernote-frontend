## Functionality

The app is a simplistic clone of evernote so once registered the user can create notes in a rich text editor. Notes are stored in notebooks(each notebook can have multiple notes). Also the user has the ability to create Tags and attatch any number of Tags to each Note. Notes, Tags and notebooks can be added to favorites for quick access.

    - in requests.js change the variable url to reflect your backend eg: `const url = "http://localhost:8000/graphql";`
