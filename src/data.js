    body: `Everything here is so cold
      Everything here is so dark
      I remember it as from a dream
      In the corner of this time
      Diabolic Shapes float by
      Out from the dark
      I remember it was here I died
      By following the freezing moon
      It's night again, night you beautiful
      I please my hunger on living humans
      Night of hunger, follow it's call
      Follow the freezing moon
      Darkness is growing, the eternity opens
      The cemetary lights up again
      As in ancient times
      Fallen souls, die behind my steps
      by following the freezing moon front end framework but 
      sometings <strong>it sucks</strong> because it changes
       all the times
       The great truth is there isn't one
      And it only gets worse since that conclusion
      The irony of being an extension to nothing
      And the force of inertia is now a vital factor
      And there is despair underneath each and every action
      Each and every attempt to pierce the armour of numbness
      Burning bridges becomes a habit to support
      And the front line expands like there's no tomorrow
      I envy the maggots
      Their stuff at least sticks together
      Better than laudations of misinformed seers
      And those are lengthy annals of shame that we work with
      It's like dumping dead meat at the brink of Styx
      With a barge that we made of what was left of Yggdrasil
      After veterans of spiritual revolts were done with their armchairs
      And I don't even remember which brink is which
      The odour of sanctity is just refined stench of existence
      Shining pearl of Augeas' crown pales in comparison
      And there is despair underneath each and every action
      Each and every attempt to pierce the armour of numbness
      Burning bridges becomes a habit to support
      And the front line expands like there's no tomorrow
      The grotesque eagles of misfortune, well fed on thanatos, sit still
      It's the dignity of scavengers at the ever growing garbage dump of life
      There is something about the rigid posture of a proper, authentic blind
      As if extended arms reached to pass his blindness onto others`,
